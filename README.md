FUTURE DIRECTIONS:

This LAMP version of a freeware accounting software is not extremely difficult to implement, even adding authentication controls and I am publishing future directions for advanced features like object persistence and automata and authentication procedures.  
There is some misunderstanding of information systems and the difference between flat files, relational databases and object-oriented databases.

Relational databases:

A good rule of thumb is the advancement from relational databases to OO with the enhanced operation of functions turning the enterprise management of data to the use of automata.
